"""
Research workflow — 9 steps:
  1. Plan search queries
  2. Search loop (max 5 iterations)
  3. Three independent researchers (each sees ALL results, each loops to fill gaps)
  4. Deliberation — each sees others' findings, cross-verifies
  5. Merge into final research report
  6. Draw conclusions (3 AIs parallel)
  7. Compare conclusions — agree/complementary/conflict
  8. Verify sources + freshness
  9. Format + confidence

Circuit breakers: 5 search iterations, 2 re-research, 3 briefing loops per researcher
