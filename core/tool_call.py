    Call a model with mid-thought tool use.

    The AI wraps tool calls in [tool use]...[/tool use] then [STOP].
    Only tags INSIDE [tool use] blocks execute — tags outside are ignored.
    JARVIS runs ALL requested lookups at once and feeds results back.

    Signals:
      [STOP]   → execute tool calls + on_stop callback, continue thinking
      [DONE]   → apply final edits, model is completely finished

    on_stop: optional callback called with full_response when [STOP] fires.
             Used by coders to apply pending edit blocks before tool lookups,
             so [CODE:] reads return the post-edit state.
             The callback MAY return a feedback string describing what
             happened to the edits (which applied, which were skipped and
             why). When it does, the string is prepended to the next-round
             prompt as an "EDIT APPLICATION RESULTS" block, so the model
             gets explicit signal instead of having to infer success by
             re-reading the file. Returning None means "no feedback to add."

    viewed_versions: optional dict updated whenever the model reads a file via
             [CODE: path]. Maps filepath → content the model just saw. Used by
             on_stop to anchor [REPLACE LINES] edits to the version the model
             was actually looking at, instead of whatever the file currently
             is on disk. Without this, a model that views V0, writes [REPLACE
             LINES 22-24], then writes more edits after a mid-stream [STOP]
             would have its V0-relative line numbers applied to the post-STOP
             file (which has different line numbers).

    Tool tags:
      [SEARCH: pattern]       → code search
      [WEBSEARCH: query]      → web search
      [DETAIL: section name]  → detailed code map lookup
      [CODE: path/to/file]    → read actual source code file
      [REFS: name]            → find all definitions, imports, usages
      [PURPOSE: category]     → all code serving a purpose (exact/fuzzy category name)
      [SEMANTIC: description] → vector embedding search over purpose categories, returns top 10 matches
      [DISCARD: #label]       → remove a labeled result from context

    research_cache: shared dict that accumulates all lookup results across
    multiple AI calls. Same tag won't re-run if cached.

    Returns {"model": str, "answer": str, "done": bool, "force_done": bool,
    "research": {tag_key: result}}.
    "done" is True when the model explicitly wrote [DONE] — it is NOT present in
    "answer" (stripped before return), so callers must check this flag, not the text.
    "force_done" is True when the model wrote [FORCE DONE][CONFIRM_FORCE_DONE] —
    the coder's escape hatch for "step requirement already met, no edits needed".
    When force_done is True, done is also True. The IMPLEMENT loop uses
    force_done to distinguish "I am intentionally producing no edits" from
    "I forgot to produce edits", which otherwise trigger a retry.
