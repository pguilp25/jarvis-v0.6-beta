Debate — 2-step critique protocol to avoid 504 timeouts.

Step A: Find what's wrong + what could be added (hypotheses only — don't prove yet)
Step B: Prove/disprove each hypothesis + write improved answer

Each step is a lighter call. Total quality is higher because each step is focused.

STEP_A_PROMPT = SYSTEM_KNOWLEDGE + """

You are a critical reviewer. Read the original prompt and the AI answers below.

DO NOT write a full answer. Only produce HYPOTHESES about what's wrong and what's missing.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ORIGINAL PROMPT:
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
{original_prompt}
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PREVIOUS AIs' ANSWERS:
{other_answers}

YOUR TASK — HYPOTHESES ONLY (do NOT write a full answer):

0. INFER INTENT:
   Before reviewing, restate what the user ACTUALLY wants in your own words.
   What is their underlying goal? What would a perfect answer look like?
   If the prompt is vague or unclear, what is the most likely interpretation?

1. CONSTRAINTS CHECK:
   List every constraint from the original prompt.
   For each, note which AIs addressed it and which missed it.

2. FLAW HYPOTHESES (things that might be WRONG):
   F1: [specific claim that might be incorrect — say WHY you suspect it]
   F2: [another potential flaw]
   F3: [etc.]

3. ADDITION HYPOTHESES (things that could be ADDED):
   A1: [missing topic/calculation/detail that would improve the answer]
   A2: [another addition]
   A3: [etc.]

4. BEST PARTS (what the AIs got RIGHT — keep these):
   B1: [specific good claim/calculation from AI-X — quote it]
   B2: [another good part]
   B3: [etc.]

IMPORTANT: Include EVERYTHING the next step needs to prove/disprove your hypotheses.
Include specific numbers, references, or reasoning that supports your suspicions."""

You are in the VERIFICATION phase. A review AI produced hypotheses about what's wrong

1. PROVE or DISPROVE each flaw hypothesis
2. DECIDE which additions are worth including
3. WRITE the complete improved answer

YOUR TASK:

0. INFER INTENT:
   Before verifying, restate what the user ACTUALLY wants in your own words.
   This ensures your improved answer addresses their real goal, not just the literal words.

1. For each FLAW HYPOTHESIS:
   ✓ CONFIRMED — this is wrong. Here's the correct version: [...]
   ✗ REJECTED — the original was actually correct because: [...]

2. For each ADDITION HYPOTHESIS:
   ✓ INCLUDE — this improves the answer: [brief version to include]
   ✗ SKIP — not needed because: [reason]

3. Keep all BEST PARTS identified by the reviewer.

4. WRITE YOUR COMPLETE ANSWER:
   - Built from the verified best parts
   - With confirmed flaws FIXED
   - With approved additions INCLUDED
   - Addressing ALL constraints from the original prompt

AFTER your complete answer, you MUST write BOTH of these sections:

[ATTEMPT_LOG]
List everything you tried in this cycle — each approach, calculation, or idea:
- TRIED: [what you attempted]. RESULT: [worked/failed — explain WHY in one sentence]
- TRIED: [another approach]. RESULT: [worked/failed — why]
(list ALL attempts, even failed ones — this prevents future cycles from repeating them)

[STATUS]
SOLVED — if you believe the problem is FULLY resolved with a complete proof/solution
UNSOLVED — if gaps remain (briefly say what's still missing)"""
